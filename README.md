- âš¡ Quantum state transitions and animations
- ðŸ“Š Real-time chronological data processing
- ðŸ”® Holographic hover interface with temporal data streams
- ðŸ“± Cross-dimensional responsive architecture
- ðŸŒŒ Dark matter aesthetic engine

## Tech Matrix

```yaml
core:
  framework: React^18.3.1
  language: TypeScript^5.5.3
  styling: TailwindCSS^3.4.1
  builder: Vite^5.4.2

dependencies:
  time_processor: date-fns^3.3.1

```

## Neural Initialization

1. Clone the neural pathway:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamakchavan/2025-in-pixels.git && cd 2025-in-pixels
```

2. Sync quantum dependencies:
```bash
npm install # Initializing neural networks...
```

3. Boot temporal server:
```bash
npm run dev # Activating chronological matrix...
```

4. Deploy to cyberspace:
```bash
npm run build # Compiling quantum states...
```

## Chromatic Matrix Guide

```css
future    = #22D3EE /* Quantum cyan pulse */
today     = #6366F1 /* Neural indigo surge */
completed = #FFFFFF /* Temporal echo */
